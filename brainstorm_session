Task 1

Insertion Sorting Algorithm

How it works:

- Divide array into sorted and unsorted part
- When sorting begins, the sorted part is the first number
- Compare the first number after the sorted part (n) to the last number in the sorted part (s)
- If s is greater than n:
	~ Compare n to every value in the sorted part (stop comparing if we find a value less than n)
	~ Add to the sorted part
